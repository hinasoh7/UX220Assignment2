# About Me

My name is Sabrina Kwai-Fai Ho, and was born on October 7, 2004 in North York Hospital. I have two older brothers, one of which works as a software engineer for a start-up company, and the other works for the CRA as an auditor. My father works for IBM as a hardware technician, and my mother works as a bookkeeper. I am currently still figuring out what career I want to partake in, but I hope it is something creative or enjoyable.

I am a second year student at Wilfrid Laurier University studying in the User Experience Design program, minoring in Business Technology Management. I have proficient experience in using all Microsoft applications, some Adobe applications, and some experience with coding in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have a passion for learning new things, especially if they are interesting technical skills. I hope to always learn new skills that can help me navigate the world, or further develop myself as a person.
