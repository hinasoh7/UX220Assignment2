# Experience Two: My Time with Hazukido

From March 2022 to July 2023, I worked at Hazukido, where I balanced customer service with pastry-making responsibilities.

I enjoyed learning the craft of handling food and drinks, especially the details of Hazukidoâ€™s unique croissant and drink recipes. I met a lot of new people, and although I did not keep in contact with them, they were a fun crowd. It was mostly people around my age at the time, and it made me a lot comfortable to know that because it was my first job.

 A highlight was getting to work with others to better understand teamwork and co-operation within a job environment, while also learning different ways to handle customers and unwanted situations.

 My favorite memory was just meeting coworkers that I could bond and relate to about different topics and hobbies. However, the rush to manage inventory during peak times was a definitely a difficult challenge that I do not miss at all.

The grade I would give this experience is a D, because I didn't enjoy it as much as I wish I could have.
