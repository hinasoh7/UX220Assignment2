# Experience Three: My Time in DECA

In DECA, I worked with a partner in the Business Law and Ethics (BLTDM) department with a focus on human resources from September 2019 to June 2020.

 I enjoyed the teamwork aspect, especially working closely with my partner to tackle complex case studies. This really helped with my future experience in my previous major, Business Technology Management (BTM). I think understanding how to tackle issues and the different ways to present them to judges really showed me how to professionally problem solve, especially when ethics was involved.

 My favorite part was the competition day, where we got to present our solution to judges, which was both thrilling and nerve-wracking. It gave me a lot of perspective on what people in the professional scene look for when they want to hear from students and found it fascinating how intricate the other competitors could think of for their solutions.

 The downside was the intense preparation required, so when I entered my first competition, I was really confused without a lot of help. There was no training or anything that could have helped us.

 I would grade this experience as a B because it could have been better but the experience was really good.
