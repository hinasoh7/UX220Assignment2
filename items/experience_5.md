# Experience Five: My Time with Momoko Brantford

Last year in November and December, I worked at Momoko Brantford as a cashier and beauty sales expert. Although it was short lived due to my busy schedule, there were some good moments.

At Momoko, I helped customers with inquiries about asian beauty products and also served them the food and drinks that they ordered. Cleaning the store and closing were part of my responsibilities as well, which I did not enjoy as I had to walk in the dark alone after work.

What I loved most was improving my customer service skills once again, while also learning about products myself that could be useful in my own self care. My favorite memory was when a customer thanked me for helping them with a product that would help with her daughter's eczema issues. However, the challenge of feeling motivated to clean the store all the time and running around to the beauty section and back to the drinks area.

Overall, I would give this experience a grade of C because I gained experience, but it was experience that I have already gained previously. It was also not as enjoyable to work in the food industry again, but I really needed a job at the time. I would say the friends and connections I made during that job was enjoyable at the very least.
