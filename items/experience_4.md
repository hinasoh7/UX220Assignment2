# Experience Four: My Time with the Orientation Week Volunteers

During the first week of school this year, my friend convinced me to come out of my shell and volunteer as an orientation week helper.

As an Orientation Week volunteer, I helped welcome new students to campus and introduced them to university life through various activities and support sessions. This included campus tours, event planning and organization, and just overall warm communication and friendships formed between team members and the first years.

This experience was incredibly fulfilling, as I could see firsthand the difference it made in easing studentsâ€™ transition to university. During my orientation week a few years ago, I was extremely nervous and did not have that much fun, but being able to make a memorable experience for the current first years made up for a lot of that.

My favorite memory was convincing some first years to participate in the lip sync battle where they decided to lip sync tequila together. Although it took a lot of time, it was really worth it because a lot of people said that it was really funny, and the first years themselves enjoyed it as well.

One of the challenges, however, was balancing long days filled with events, which could be tiring. I have social anxiety and just a lot of issues regarding my energy levels and mental health, so going through that entire week was really tough. Despite this, I would give this experience an A for the valuable connections made and the rewarding sense of contributing to a positive start for the new students.
