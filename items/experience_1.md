# Experience One: My Time with Re/Max Epic Realty

In the summer of 2023, I worked for Re/Max Epic Realty under Annie Li, who is a broker.

During my time at REMAX Epic Realty, I assisted Annie with organizational tasks and social media marketing for current and future property projects. I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to learn about real estate marketing, especially when I saw positive engagement on the social media posts I crafted. I helped with event planning, resource planning, and communicated quite frequently with my boss and colleague about what they were looking for in my work.

One memorable moment was when I befriended my colleague, Connie, who is a mother of kids around my age. She was extremely friendly and would help translate a lot of Mandarin for me because I only speak Cantonese.

I really enjoyed the fast-paced and professional environment. I really think that helped with my experience in the professional scene, especially with the design part. As a UX major, the design programs that I used was also very helpful in gaining experience for my future career. I didn't enjoy how I would need to wake up early to get to my job, but that's just the reality of things.

I would grade this experience as an A, as it honestly couldn't be better.
